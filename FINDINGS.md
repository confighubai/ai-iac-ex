# Key findings

Successful Initialization in Most Workspaces (4o, claude3.5sonnet, gemini1206)

Provider Versions:
- 4o: Used hashicorp/aws v4.67.0 provider.
- claude3.5sonnet: Installed multiple providers: hashicorp/tls v4.0.6, hashicorp/aws v5.80.0, and hashicorp/kubernetes v2.34.0.
- gemini1206: Used hashicorp/aws v5.80.0 provider

The differences in provider sets and versions suggest that claude3.5sonnet and gemini1206 are potentially using more recent or more complex infrastructure code compared to 4o.

Failure in the o1 Workspace:

```
Error: Duplicate data "aws_subnets" configuration

A aws_subnets data resource named "public" was already declared at eks-workers.tf:37,1-28. Resource names must be unique per type in each module.
```
